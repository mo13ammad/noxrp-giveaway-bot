# üéÅ Nox RP Discord Giveaway Bot  
(c) 2025 ViraUp (viraup.com) ‚Äì All rights reserved.  

A Discord giveaway bot for Nox RP written in Python.
It manages countdown-based reply giveaways with quiet hours, admin exemptions, and automatic locking on winner selection.
Countdown progress is stored in a local SQLite database so the giveaway can recover after unexpected restarts.

## üîß Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python main.py
```
