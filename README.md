# üéÅ Nox RP Discord Giveaway Bot  
(c) 2025 ViraUp (viraup.com) ‚Äì All rights reserved.  

A Discord giveaway bot for Nox RP written in Python.
It manages countdown-based reply giveaways with quiet hours, admin exemptions, and automatic locking on winner selection.
Countdown progress is stored in a local SQLite database so the giveaway can recover after unexpected restarts.
The countdown message also shows the active participant's invite- and role-bonus stats (applied only).

## üîß Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python main.py
```

### Permissions & Intents

- Enable `Message Content Intent` and `Server Members Intent` for the bot in the Developer Portal.
- Grant the bot permission to view the giveaway channel, manage messages, and fetch invites (`Manage Guild` or appropriate invite permissions) so invite bonuses work.
- The role-bonus feature relies on `on_member_update` to detect when an invited user later receives a participant role.
